# 🚀 Trellis GitHub Deployment

Automatically deploy your [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/)-based WordPress site to `staging` and `production` environments on merge to `staging` and `main` branches respectively, and keep plugins, themes, and WordPress core up to date with Dependabot.

## Features

- 🚀 **Automatic (or manual) deployment** to `staging` and `production` environments using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) when pull requests are merged to your `staging` and `main` branches respectively.
- 🔄 **On-Demand one-way sync** database and assets from `production` to `staging`.
- 🔗 **Maintains a history of [GitHub Deployments](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#create-a-deployment)** and provides links to the current deployments in each environment.
- 🔑 **Re-set deployment keys on-demand** when you need to change who has access to `staging` or `production`.
- 📦 **WordPress plugin, core, and theme updates** managed with [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/about-dependabot-version-updates).
